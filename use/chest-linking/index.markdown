title: Chest linking
---

Unless your sign is owned by the server, where items are created out of thin air, you will need to connect your sign to a chest.

To connect a chest, type `/duckshop link`.
Then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the link.
Links are saved automatically, so you only need to connect it once.

Chest linking uses the same [permissions][] as placing signs, so to link a chest, you must have the appropriate `create` permission.

[permissions]: {{ site.baseurl }}/install/permissions
