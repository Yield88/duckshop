Make your first shop
--------------------

People learn best by doing, so let's begin by doing stuff!

1. Place a chest and fill it with cobblestone.
   The shop will take items from this chest.

2. Write a sign like this:

       YourName
       64 cobble
       free

   using your own name instead of `YourName`.
   Make the last line blank.

3. You should see a helpful message.
   If this doesn't happen, break the sign and try again.

4. Type `/ds link` to connect the chest.
   Follow the on-screen instructions (punch the sign, then the chest).

5. The sign should be working now.
   Right click the sign to get a free stack of cobblestone.
